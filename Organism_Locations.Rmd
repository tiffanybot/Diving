## Where are Tritonia?

People have reported seeing Tritonia at two sites, so far: Sunshine Cove and Coughlan Island. A video was even supplied by Mike Navarro! Here are screenshots from one of his dives at Coughlan Island. 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
img1_path = "images/nudi1.png"
img2_path = "images/nudi2.png"
include_graphics(img1_path)
include_graphics(img2_path)
```



```{r, echo = FALSE}
# new data frame for all cores
locations_all = or.locs %>%
  distinct(or.locs, latitude_N, longitude_E, site) %>%
  drop_na()

# map "locations_all"
leaflet(locations_all) %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addMarkers(~longitude_E, ~latitude_N, popup = ~site, label = ~site)
```
